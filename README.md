## 🧩 Overview

**Onchain Quest** is an interactive, gamified social experience built entirely onchain on the **Base** network. The project was created during the **Base Onchain Summer 2024 Hackathon**, in the **Gaming & Social** category.

The application combines **onchain identity, NFT progression, and wallet interactions** in a multi-level quest where users verify steps by interacting with smart contracts, switching networks, and connecting social identities such as Farcaster.

Each level represents a deeper integration into the onchain ecosystem — turning learning and onboarding into a fun and rewarding game.
